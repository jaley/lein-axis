  "Use Apache Axis to generate Java classes for WSDL files.

You will need to add Apache Axis to your project as a dependency, e.g.:
...
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure \"1.2.0\"]
                 [org.clojure/clojure-contrib \"1.2.0\"]
		 [axis/axis \"1.4\"]]

Then, to configure what WSDL files to use and where to put the generated
source files:
...
  :java-source-path \"src/java\"
  :axis [[\"src/wsdl/myservice.wsdl\" \"generated.myservice\"]
	 [\"src/wsdl/myotherservice.wsdl\" \"generated.myotherservice\"]]

Note that :java-source-path is used by the lein-javac plug-in, which is
probably the easiest way to turn the Java code generated into compiled
classes. lein-axis uses this setting as the target directory (for the
root of the generated packages). src/java is used as a default if you
don't provide this value.
